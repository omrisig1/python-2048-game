# python-2048-game
just a small 2048 game i felt like making with python and pygame

while first creating a few functions for manipulating 2d array like in 2048,
I decided to create the full game.

I made the functionality with plain python, then I need to learn some of the pygame library in order to 
create the GUI.

you can examine the code, starting with file game2048.py.

if you want to play you can download the zip and run the exe.
Enjoy :)
